# 3GPP TDoc Tracker - Project Status

## Overview
A web application for managing 3GPP TDoc agenda items with approval workflow, revision tracking, and version control. Built with Svelte and Vite for fast performance.

## Main Requirements (Enhanced)
- Load data from 3GPP HTML agenda files with individual cell color preservation
- Separate "My Approval" and "My Comments" columns for better workflow
- Set approval status: Approve, Note, Revise, Postpone, Not Pursue (verb-based buttons)
- State validation: Actions only enabled for "available", "reserved", and "revised" decision states
- Color-code based on decision states using original 3GPP colors (#99FF33 green, #FFFF99 yellow, #FF8566 red)
- Create revisions with parent-child linking and proper state management
- Reply to LS In entries with LS Out numbers
- Sync/rebase user changes when importing newer HTML versions
- Export with file save dialog and maintain original HTML format with tooltip merge

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

**Core Data Management:**
- HTML parser extracts TDoc data from 3GPP agenda files
- Preserves original styling and color coding from source HTML
- Version control system with date/timestamp naming
- Auto-rebase functionality applies user changes to new HTML imports
- LocalStorage persistence across sessions

**User Interface:**
- Clean Svelte-based responsive interface
- Top toolbar with approval action buttons
- Row selection with blue outline highlighting
- Sidebar for version management and switching
- Removed redundant Actions column for cleaner layout

**Approval Workflow:**
- Single-row selection system
- Top toolbar buttons: Approved, Noted, Revised, Postponed, Not Pursued
- Approval status automatically added to comments column
- Visual color coding: green (approved/noted/revised), yellow (postponed/not pursued)

**Advanced Workflows:**
- **Revision System**: Creates new TDoc with "reserved" status, marks parent as "revised"
- **LS Reply System**: Reply to LS In entries with LS Out numbers
- **Hyperlink Preservation**: Maintains internal links in Replaced-by/Replaces columns
- **Tooltip Support**: Preserves and displays tooltips from original HTML

**Export/Import:**
- Generates HTML export matching original 3GPP format
- Preserves all user changes, comments, and approval statuses
- UTF-8 encoding with proper character escaping
- Can re-import exported files without data loss

**Technical Features:**
- Sticky table headers and section headers for navigation
- Agenda/topic grouping with floating section headers
- Consistent date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- No external dependencies beyond Svelte for performance

### üîß Current Technical State

**Architecture:**
- `src/App.svelte` - Main application component with state management
- `src/Toolbar.svelte` - Top action buttons and file operations
- `src/TdocTable.svelte` - Data display with grouping and selection
- `src/VersionSidebar.svelte` - Version management interface
- `src/parser.js` - HTML parsing and data extraction logic
- `src/app.css` - Styling with sticky headers and color schemes

**Data Model:**
- Original fields: agenda, topic, tdocNumber, title, source, type, for, avail, treated, decision, wdrn, replacedBy, replaces
- Enhanced fields: userApproval, userComments, originalColorClass, treatedTooltip, hyperlink references
- Version tracking: timestamp, name, tdocs array, metadata

**Key Functions:**
- `parseTdocHtml()` - Extracts data from HTML with tooltip and link preservation
- `createNewVersion()` - Version management with auto-rebase
- `applyApprovalStatus()` - Handles approval workflow
- `handleRevision()` - Creates revision entries with proper linking
- `generateHtmlExport()` - Produces standards-compliant HTML output

### üöÄ Usage Instructions

1. **Start Application**: `npm run dev` 
2. **Load Data**: Click "Load HTML" and select 3GPP agenda file
3. **Select Row**: Click any TDoc row (blue outline appears)
4. **Apply Actions**: Use top toolbar buttons for approval/revision/LS reply
5. **Manage Versions**: Use sidebar to switch between imported versions
6. **Export Results**: Click "Export HTML" to save with all changes

### üéØ Key Achievements

- **Performance**: Fast, lightweight implementation with minimal dependencies
- **Compatibility**: Maintains full compatibility with original 3GPP HTML format
- **Workflow**: Streamlined approval process with single-point control
- **Data Integrity**: Preserves all original data, links, and tooltips
- **User Experience**: Clean interface with sticky navigation and clear visual feedback

### üìù Notes for Future Development

- Application is fully functional for core 3GPP TDoc management workflows
- All original requirements have been implemented and tested
- Export/import cycle maintains data integrity
- Revision and LS reply workflows follow 3GPP standards
- Interface optimized for productivity with minimal clicks required

The application successfully transforms the static 3GPP HTML agenda format into an interactive workflow management tool while preserving all original formatting and data integrity.
